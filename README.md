# LightningSticks

**Lightningsticks** is a plugin inspired from Hypixel's Lightning Sticks plugin, where you are able to give out lightning sticks to all online players in a lobby.
The concept of this plugin is to give a lightning stick to a target player or all players online.

Thanks to hypewsthedev and his help with the creation of this plugin.
